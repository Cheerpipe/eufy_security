I have baked a custom integration to control Eufy Security Cameras and access RSTP (real time streaming protocol) stream if possible. You can turn on and turn off cameras and if your camera is on, you can view live stream. Morevoer, there are some additional sensors for motion detection, person detection, battery level and wifi signal.

Installation;
 This integration relies on [eufy-security-ws](https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-ws) to communicate with cloud and local endpoints which means that you need to setup a local npm server and you need to configure this custom integration to communicate with that npm server.
 
 Eufy Security WS is the main library that enables to communicate with eufy devices or servers directly but it is built for general purpose so it doesn't have direct connection with Home Assistant. With this integration, you can get connected your instance of Eufy Securty WS. So it means that you should be running WS in a docker or in a node instance first, then setup this integration to communicate with WS. When you are setting up WS, you will be setting up the desired port to listen on, when setting up the integration, you need to share the IP address of the docker/rasperry pi/machine and port you have used.

In simple steps assuming you have docker support in your environment

1- Follow steps 1/2/3 below and replace this step for 4/5/6/7 and continue from 8 (including)
```
docker run -it
-e USERNAME=email@address.com
-e PASSWORD=password_goes_here
-v "$(PWD)"/data:/data
-p 3000:3000
bropat/eufy-security-ws:latest
```

In detailed steps;
 
 1- Download Node over here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ - If you have Node-Red running already, it means you have this.
 
 2- Checkout latest codebase of eufy-security-ws: `git clone https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-ws` - I have created a Pull Request into original codebase to get instant updates on thumbnails. Until it is merged, you can use my clone codebase.
 
 3- Previous command will create a folder named as eufy-security-ws, now change your directory into it`cd eufy-security-ws`
 
 4- Create a file here named as `config.json` and edit it using this `nano config.json`
 
 5- Fill this file with these format `{"username": "email@address.com", "password": "password_goes_here"}`
 
 6- Save and exit using Ctrl+X and Yes
 
 7- Execute these commands
    ```
    npm install
    npm install typescript ts-node
    npx ts-node .\src\bin\server.ts
    ```

8- Your local eufy security server should be up and running in port 3000.

9- Install home assistant integration and set eufy security server's host name and port using UI.

10- Raise your issues in Github.
